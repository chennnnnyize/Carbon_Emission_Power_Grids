In the electricity power networks, each
generator can have distinct carbon emission rates. Due to the ex-
istence of physical power flows, nodal power consumption is met
by a combination of a set of generators, while such combination is
determined by network topology, generatorsâ€™ and lines' characteristics, and
power demand. This work describes a technique based on physical
power flow model, which can efficiently compute the nodal carbon
emissions contributed by each single generator given the gener-
ation and power flow information. We also extend the technique
to calculate both the nodal average carbon emission and marginal
carbon emission rates. Simulation results validate the effectiveness
of the calculations, while our technique provides a fundamental tool
for applications such as carbon auditing, carbon-oriented demand
management and future carbon-oriented capacity expansion.
